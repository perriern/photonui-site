The file manager provides you two ways to open file stored on the user's hard disk:

* by using a "file open" dialog

* by allowing file to be drag & dropped on your web app


__NOTE:__ You cannot open the "file open" dialog as you wish. The `photonui.FileManager.open` method **must** be called in response to an user event (click,...) else the browser will not allow you to open the dialog.
